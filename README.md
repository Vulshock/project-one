## Goals:
  - Find out what makes a good movie using a combination of the tmdb and rotten tomatoes datasets we found via Kaggle and use of python/jupyter notebook.
      -Questions:
        - Do viewers and critics agree on if a movie is good?
        - Does runtime affect a movies rating?
        - Within a genre what (work on this)
## Process:
  - Through the use of jupyter notebooks and python we looked into:
        # - Merging csvs to find the full list of information of a movie
        # - Manipulation of dataframes to gather relevant points of data including:
          #  - Name of movie
          #  - Studio
          #  - Critic rating (tomatometer)
          #  - Audience rating
          #  - Runtime
          #  - Budget
          #  - Revenue
          #  - Year of Release
       -Building graphs to provide visual representation of our answers
## Conclusion
  - Through our manipulation of these data sets we found that:
        - Runtimes of movies have no affect on how it is critically scored
        - Sample of votes between audience and critics are to disproportionate to be deemed usfull
        - Audiences tend to be more lenient then critics with reviews
